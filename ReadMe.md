# ZenType Themes : Basic #

A theme showing not much apart from the content. Similar to the [Skeleton](https://github.com/zentype-themes/skeleton)
theme however there is:

* no configuration enabled at all, so you can't edit any options, menus, social links or images
* no CSS styling

Seriously, there's nothing here - so that makes it a great way to start your own theme or learn how to create ZenType
themes.

## Usage ##

Firstly clone this repo somewhere. We recommend doing this inside a `themes` directory in the current working directory
from where you launch ZenType:

```
cd path/to/themes
git clone https://github.com/zentype-themes/skeleton.git
```

Then, change the theme for your blog in the Domain Edit page and then republish your site.
